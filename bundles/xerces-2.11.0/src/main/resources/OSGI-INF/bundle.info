    Xerces2 Java is a library for parsing, validating and manipulating XML documents.

    Xerces 2.x introduced the Xerces Native Interface (XNI), a complete framework for building parser components and
    configurations that is extremely modular and easy to program. XNI is merely an internal set of interfaces.
    There is no need for an XML application programmer to learn XNI if they only intend to interface to the Xerces2
    parser using standard interfaces like JAXP, DOM, and SAX. Xerces developers and application developers that need
    more power and flexibility than that provided by the standard interfaces should read and understand XNI.

    The latest version released, 2.11.0, provides support for the following standards and APIs:

        * XML 1.0 (4th Edition)
        * Namespaces in XML 1.0 (2nd Edition)
        * XML 1.1 (2nd Edition)

        * W3C XML Schema 1.0 (2nd Edition)
        * W3C XML Schema 1.1 (Working Drafts, December 2009)
        * W3C XML Schema Definition Language (XSD): Component Designators (Candidate Recommendation, January 2010)
        * XInclude 1.0 (2nd Edition)
        * OASIS XML Catalogs 1.1
        * SAX 2.0.2
        * DOM Level 3 Core, Load and Save
        * DOM Level 2 Core, Events, Traversal and Range
